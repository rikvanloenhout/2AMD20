Preprocessing ideas:
World crime index: split country and city.
All datasets: check types of columns

Combine all datasets on the country column
Retain columns

Look at the questions of chapter 4, explore if they are applicable to the combined dataset

Identify factors by: 
Correlation matrices

Split the work:
2 groups, 2 chapters each.
For next week, finish 1/2 chapters. For group with ch 3+4, make sure 4 is finished next week.

Rik & Pim, chapters 3&4, have ch4 done next week.
Alexander & Omar, chapters 1&2, have one of them done next week.
